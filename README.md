Turku Business Region Ultrahack / Hack the spread of epidemics
How to combine state of the art contamination detection with a hand sanitizer? The price of modern hyperspectral imaging technology has come down, and it is continuing to go down to fractions what it used to be. It will be possible to create smart sanitizers or soap dispensers that tell you which soap and how you should use. With digitalization, it will be possible to monitor and guide the handwashing procedures. It also makes possible to reward those individuals that already are promoting great hygiene by their example. With these emerging technologies, handwashing becomes more efficient, ecological and safer without compromising the overall hygiene.

# Autodetecting hand washing cleanliness

## Problem

Current hand sanitizers and soaps kill everything. The most effective hand and body washing soaps such as triclosan, triclocarban, methyl-, ethyl-, propyl- and butyl- parabens are so effective they can cause the formation of superbacteria. Over washing of hands can lead to skin irritation and loss of time and money. On the other hand, skin problems and hurry leads to under washing and growth of bacteria.
Killing all the bacteria with the perfect amount and correct soap requires more effort and skill from the person doing the washing.
How can we use safer soaps without compromising the overall hygiene quality?

## Solution

Integrating an automated cleanliness detector to a soap dispenser (or to a cleanliness gate) allows immediate feedback to the user on the cleanliness level of their hands. This leads to:

## Better personal hygiene

- The cleanliness of hands is recorded and monitored. Access to further premises can be prevented in the case on unclean hands.

- Immediate feedback teaches people how to wash their hands properly. The dispenser provides positive feedback and rewards users. The dispenser can also punish the user by make them wash their hands one more time (e.g. using traditional methods, sanitizers, disinfectants).

- The instant feedback changes the overall culture in a gentle way via gamification. An objective notion “you missed a spot” or “well done” message with happy face symbol will change the group behavior. This is seen e.g. traffic where happy and sad faces are much more effective than just a blinking lights telling you are speeding.

## No more strong sanitizers

- Detecting the cleanliness level allows people with already clean hands use less soap. It is not necessary to always use alcohols or other germicides in hand washing.

- Some germs are good! Using super strong sanitizers is not good for any organism, including humans. The trends and visions are towards ecological and even water free hand washing.

## Digitizing the hygiene

- In addition to feedback, the system can prevent diseases from spreading by guiding the facility managers. A bacterial source or problem areas can be identified as the device can record the hygiene levels before or after washing.

- Monitoring long-term trends allows to adjust the hygiene training. Focus can be shifted towards the problem areas and there is no need to bother the communities with good hygiene.

- Reacting to sudden changes is easier with objective, real time information.

# Project plan during the hackathon


The goal during the hackathon is to create a feasible business model and interface for a smart soap dispenser or cleanliness gate that:

- detects the cleanliness level of hands
- suggests a correct soap: ecological, super strong or regular
- gives instant feedback towards best practices in hand washing
- includes a WOW-effect for end users

On the business model side we take into consideration the:

- price of the end product or IoT-service
- more detailed customer and end user needs
- timetable for a pilot project

The technology that we are proposing is already utilized in AutoDet project in Aalto University by the core team. The goal is to create an automated surface cleanliness detector for reasonable price and simple operation.
At this point, the hardware is expensive (~10 000 euros) but the prices are coming down rapidly. In a few years, the prices will come down significantly, even to the consumer affordable level (~100 euros).
As already mentioned in the challenge material, the business opportunities in the environmental testing markets are huge: Effective infection prevention and control reduces health care-associated infections by at least 30% (WHO). By hand washing respiratory and intestinal diseases can be reduced by 25-30% (Globalhandwashing.org).
